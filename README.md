# PokeAI
PokeAI is a Web Interface using React that works exactly like ChatGPT but that works fully locally so with 100% privacy !!!

## Why would you use this ?
- Learn to download/run LLMs on your own computer using llama.cpp or ollama
- Create an API from those LLMS
- Query them and manage the stream you GET

## And after that...
You have now the choice to stop there and to just use another LLM than the 99% of people who use ChatGPT from openAI,
But you can also go farther and fine-tune/train the model with your own data to adapt the utility of your chatbot.
That's my goal for this repository, I want to create the perfect Pok√©mons professor
